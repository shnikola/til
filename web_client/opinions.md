## Moje

Tehnologija koju danas imamo je fascinanta, ali naša upotreba baš i nije ("novi monitor će prikazati boje koje nikad niste vidjeli... da bi bolje vidjeli boju cipela koje prodajem u webshopu.")

## Website obesity crisis

"We're in a stupid situation where ads make huge profits for data carriers and ad networks, at the expense of everyone else."

"Dumb ads will mean less ad revenue, because a lot of online ad spending is fueled by extravagant promises around the possibilities of surveillance technology. But the ad market is going to implode anyway when the current bubble bursts."

"Rather than trying to make your overbuilt projects look simple, ask yourself if they can't just be simple."
"The same thing happens in the browser. The core technology is so fast and good that we’ve been able to pile crap on top of it and still have it work tolerably well."

"Everything we do to make it harder to create a website or edit a web page, and harder to learn to code by viewing source, promotes that consumerist vision of the web.

Pretending that one needs a team of professionals to put simple articles online will become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Overcomplicating the web means lifting up the ladder that used to make it possible for people to teach themselves and surprise everyone with unexpected new ideas."

Let’s preserve the web as the hypertext medium it is, the only thing of its kind in the world, and not turn it into another medium for consumption, like we have so many examples of already.

Let’s commit to the idea that as computers get faster, and as networks get faster, the web should also get faster.

Let’s not allow the panicked dinosaurs of online publishing to trample us as they stampede away from the meteor. Instead, let's hide in our holes and watch nature take its beautiful course.

Most importantly, let’s break the back of the online surveillance establishment that threatens not just our livelihood, but our liberty. Not only here in Australia, but in America, Europe, the UK—in every free country where the idea of permanent, total surveillance sounded like bad science fiction even ten years ago.

## Web development as a hack of hacks

* Javascript nije loš jezik, samo nije jezik s kojim si naučio raditi.
* Problem nije u milijun frameworka koji postoje, nego u pretpostavci da ti treba framework kako bi bilo što napravio. Nauči osnovni JS i CSS i lako ćeš raditi s bilo čime.
* Front-end će uvijek biti složeniji od backenda, jer je environment u kojem radiš (browseri) izrazito promjenjiv. Zato ne podcjenjuj front-end development. Sve je to pravo programiranje.
