## Utilitarianism

Utilitarianism is a moral theory claiming that an action is moral if it makes the world a better place. But what do we mean by “a better place”?

Suppose you decide (as Jeremy Bentham did) that it means increasing the total amount of happiness in the universe as much as possible – the greatest good for the greatest number. Then you run into a so-called “repugnant conclusion”. The philosophers quantify happiness into “utils”, some arbitrary small unit of happiness. Suppose your current happiness level is 100 utils. And suppose you could sacrifice one util of happiness to create another person whose total happiness is two utils: they are only 1/50th as happy as you are. This person seems quite unhappy by our standards. But crucially, their total happiness is positive; they would (weakly) prefer living to dying. Maybe we can imagine this as a very poor person in a war-torn Third World country who is (for now) not actively suicidal.

It would seem morally correct to make this sacrifice. After all, you are losing one unit of happiness to create two units, increasing the total happiness in the universe. In fact, it would seem morally correct to keep making the sacrifice as many times as you get the opportunity. The end result is that you end up with a happiness of 1 util – barely above suicidality – and also there are 99 extra barely-not-suicidal people in war-torn Third World countries.

And the same moral principles that lead you to make the sacrifice bind everyone else alike. So the end result is everyone in the world ends up with the lowest possible positive amount of happiness, plus there are billions of extra near-suicidal people in war-torn Third World countries.

This seems abstract, but in some sense it might be the choice on offer if we have to decide whether to control population growth (thus preserving enough resources to give everyone a good standard of living), or continue explosive growth so that there are many more people but not enough resources for any of them to live comfortably.

The so-called “repugnant conclusion” led many philosophers away from “total utilitarianism” to “average utilitarianism”. Here the goal is still to make the world a better place, but it gets operationalized as “increase the average happiness level per person”. The repugnant conclusion clearly fails at this, so we avoid that particular trap.

But here we fall into another ambush: wouldn’t it be morally correct to kill unhappy people? This raises average happiness very effectively!

So we make another amendment. We’re not in the business of raising happiness, per se. We’re in the business of satisfying preferences. People strongly prefer not to die, so you can’t just kill them. Killing them actively lowers the average number of satisfied preferences.

Philosopher Roger Chao combines these and other refinements of the utilitarian method into a moral theory he calls negative average preference utilitarianism, which he considers the first system of ethics to avoid all the various traps and pitfalls. It says: an act is good if it decreases the average number of frustrated preferences per person.

## Peter Singer and Effective Altruism

Čovjek u skupom kaputu prolazi pokraj obale, i vidi dijete kako se utapa, mora donijeti odluku: ili spasiti život i upropastiti kaput vrijedan $100, ili produžiti dalje. Čovjek odlučuje da ne želi upropastiti kaput, i pušta dijete da se utopi.

Singer tvrdi da je to moralno neispravna odluka. To znači da u svakoj situaciji gdje možemo spasiti djetetov život za $100, trebamo to napraviti. U današnjem svijetu, $100 može kupiti hranu za izgladnjelu djecu, lijekove protiv malarije, ili kartu iz zaraćenog područja. Ako kupiš kaput za $100 umjesto da ih doniraš humanitarnoj organizaciji, donosiš jednaku odluku kao čovjek iz priče, birajući luksuz umjesto spašavanja nevinih života.

## Moral Offset

Offseting je kompenziranje loše stvari rađenjem nečeg dobrog. Primjerice, ako ti je stalo do okoliša, nakon leta avionom koji ispušta mnogo ugljičnog dioksida, platit ćeš kako bi se ista količina ugljičnog dioksida uklonila. Ovo je dosta zgodno, jer umjesto se osjećaš loše zbog svojih praznika u Francuskoj, možeš platiti dodatnih $70 i uživati bez grižnje savjesti.

Ali ofseetting je nezgodan jer dovodi u pitanje granice. Možemo li ubiti neprijatelja, pa se iskupiti s dovoljno novca kojim bi spasili nečiji život? Može li Bill Gates sravniti grad granatama, i zatim izgraditi bolji grad negdje drugdje?
