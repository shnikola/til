## Spomenici

After the war, Tito embarked a plan to modernize and unite Yugoslavians in utopian communist solidarity. As he recognized, his plan to help Yugoslavia forge a united culture faced unique challenges.

From 1960 until 1980, Tito commissioned more than 100 monuments commemorating the victims of fascism. Remarkably, these monuments did not recall the Second World War, but looked towards a future of freedom, equality, independence, progress and a better life for everyone – a future that could only exist thanks to the fact that others had given their life. In order for the monument to appeal to all different inhabitants (regardless of their nationality or religion), a new form of language had to be invented. Consequently, these monuments do not contain the symbols of ideologies, war heroes, or religions. Instead , they are abstract forms that refer to the modern future. In a country with many different cultures, ethnicities, identities and truths, these monuments–regardless of their location–belonged to every Yugoslavian. These monuments parted with a history in which there was always tension and a place where borders were constantly shifting.

Today, most spomeniks are now abandoned and many are in states of ruin. Their state of neglect is as expressive as their creation. They have transformed into monuments to a failed dream. A dream of fully automated luxury space communism, 300 years too early.
