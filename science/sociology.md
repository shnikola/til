## Games and Rituals (Levi Strauss)

All games are defined by a set of rules which in practice allow the playing of any number of matches. Ritual, which is also 'played', is on the other hand, like a favored instance of a game, remembered from among the possible ones because it is the only one which results in a particular type of equilibrium.

Games thus appear to have a disjunctive effect: the end in the establishment of a difference between individual players or teams where originally there was no indication of inequality. At the end of the game, they are distinguished into winners and losers. Rituals, on the other hand, is the exact inverse: it conjoins, for it brings about a union, or in any case an organic relation between two initially separate groups.

## Cults of Twitter

3rd wave feminism - . It does not have any tangible impact on real problems facing the vulnerable in society: many women, and also children, the aged, and many men

seems obsessed with posture and gesture. It is a Facebook movement, narcissist to the core.

There are real problems to solve. BLC ignores such problems. Instead, it takes the guilt of the recently well-off, casts it into the worst kind of tribalism, and then promises a future where "whiteness" is eradicated.

3WF and BLC are similar in key ways. They both worship the god Ego, with different prophets. They both speak to the same pampered, indolent middle class. They both focus on the same villains: the white male establishment, aka the "Patriarchy."

And both cults go one step further: they claim the status of absolute victim, and in doing so they deny the real victims their place. 3WF ignores the spread of vulnerability across society, particularly children and the elderly. BLC ignores the mass of poverty that cannot claim one drop of African or Native American blood. It is not a small mass, as Donald Trump knows.

Which brings me to our third cult, the reactionary right, or RR. It is arguably the more dangerous of the three. The RR claims to address the damage that the 3WF and BLC do, yet it is profoundly racist, and just as divisive.

The 3WF and BLC have left a huge mass of ordinary men and women without voice in the debate over where our society should go. The RR finds this mass of people, and speaks to their vulnerability. It attacks 3WF and BLC eloquently, and without fear. Whereas most people shirk from confrontation with armies of sock puppets, RR loves the confrontation.

In general the only people who seek out psychopaths to argue with are worse psychopaths.

## why censorship of Truly Dangerous Opinion (TDO) is bad:

It creates a black market in TDOs. Like prohibition of alcohol or drugs, this makes TDOs harder, not easier to fight. The censorship of Nazi propaganda in Germany since the end of WW2 did not stop the underground neo-Nazi movement. When you bring TDO into the open, you can argue it and destroy it.

It creates a censor. And the censor always has their own, plastic opinion of what TDO is. If the censor is honest and sincere, it can be hijacked.

We need TDO to argue against. TDO is the Devil's Advocate. When someone advocates slavery, this gives us a chance to better understand and attack modern day slavery. When someone advocates racism, this forces us to argue for multiculturalism.

"The peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error." John Stuart Mill wrote in, "On Liberty

Censorship is a goals of all cults, because it gives them the Holy Grail of informal tribunals with unwritten rules. You'll see this demand made over and over: "give us power to enforce our opinions over others". It is really a call for dissolution of the State, and the handing of power to self-selected individuals. A form of anarchy where the strongest rule over the weak. It is the psychopath's wet dream.

## Tolerancija

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance

U društvu koje tolerira sve, toleranciju preotimaju i uništavaju netolerantni. Društvo ne može biti beskrajno tolerantno. Mora biti netolerantno na netoleranciju.

Na ovaj način netolerantna manjina može vršiti dikatuturu nad tolerantnom većinom. Npr. ako se muškarac želi oženiti za muslimanku, i on sam mora postati musliman. Ako se poslije i razvede, ne može prestati biti musliman jer se apostaza u Islamu kažnjava smrtnom kaznom. Islam je istisnuo kršćanstvo zbog svoje netolerantosti, kao što je i kršćanstvo istisnulo paganske religije prije sebe koje su bile tolerantne prema svakom obliku štovanja.

Knjige se ne zabranjuju i ljudi se ne stavljaju na crne liste zato što smetaju prosječnom građaninu, nego zato što smetaju nekolicini motiviranih aktivista, a ostatak stanovništva su prepasivni da bi ih bilo briga.
