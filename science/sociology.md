## Games and Rituals (Levi Strauss)

All games are defined by a set of rules which in practice allow the playing of any number of matches. Ritual, which is also 'played', is on the other hand, like a favored instance of a game, remembered from among the possible ones because it is the only one which results in a particular type of equilibrium.

Games thus appear to have a disjunctive effect: the end in the establishment of a difference between individual players or teams where originally there was no indication of inequality. At the end of the game, they are distinguished into winners and losers. Rituals, on the other hand, is the exact inverse: it conjoins, for it brings about a union, or in any case an organic relation between two initially separate groups.
