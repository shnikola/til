## Boil It Down

https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Boil_it_down_(1924)

If you've got a thought that's happy,
Boil it down.
Make it short and crisp and snappy,
Boil it down.

When your brain its coin has minted,
Down the page your pen has sprinted,
If you want your effort printed,
Boil it down.

Take out every surplus letter,
Boil it down.
Fewer syllables the better,
Boil it down.

Make your meaning plain.
Express it so we'll know not merely guess it;
then my friend ere you address it,
Boil it down.

Cut out all the extra trimmings,
Boil it down.
Skim it well, then skim the skimmings,
Boil it down.

When you're sure 'twould be a sin to
Cut another sentence into,
send it on, and we'll begin to,
BOIL IT DOWN!

## Kako biti subverzivan danas

https://youtu.be/93sV5XGLmgQ?t=2h5m33s

Danas se čini nemoguće biti subverzivan. Ali postoje područja koja su zapostavljena, o kojima nitko ne priča i koja se izbjegavaju (npr. u Moorovom slučaju pornografija, i magija). Samim time nitko i ne pokušava promijeniti kako se to područje doživljava. Često su to vrlo funndametalna, bitna područja koja jednostavno trenutno nisu pomodna.

## Lessons from the screenplay

Početak scene stvara okvir o čemu se radi sceni, sužavajući se prema zadnjoj riječi ili rečenici u kojoj je poanta cijele scene.

*Subplot character* prolazi kroz iste probleme kao protagonist, a publici daje kontrast.

Lessons from "Independence day": epic antagonist, action is about characters, be mean to characters

Ultimate antagonist:
* exceptionally good at attacking the hero's greates weekness
* pressuring protagonosti into difficult choices
* competing for the same goal forces them into direct conflict

Establiraj da se može umrijeti u filmu kako bi povećao napetost (npr. Moonrise Kingdom gdje ubiju psa).

Protagonist causes things to happen, not has things happen to them.
